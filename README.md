# top-foundations-landing-page
Repo for the landing page project of The Odin Project curriculum

This is the first "real" page that I have built from scratch.  It was a challenge incorporating everything that I have learned about html and css into this one project, especially because I started with zero code.

Things I had to learn include..
  - how to import Google Fonts
  - how to make rounded edges
  - the figcaption element

Things I worked through include..
  - how to start a page from scratch, conceptualizing the html and css
  - exactly how many flexbox items I would need in order to manipulate elements the way I wanted

Things I could improve upon..
  - I think I can clean up the code and remove some bloating
  - There are some elements with static sizes and positioning.  They appear to work as intended but I could look at other ways to make them more dynamic.
